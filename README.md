## Description
This is just a little project to sharpen my react skills. Nothing fancy. It's a quick description of who I am and what I do. I built it with React focusing on making a single page application with conditional rendering and making use of react components.

## Installation Instructions
Download the source. Run "npm i". Wait for it to install dependancies. Run "npm start". It should open in a new browser window.


## Contribution Guidelines
This is not a project that's really suitable for contribution, but if you really feel like you must... hit me up.
